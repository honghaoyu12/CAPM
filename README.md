# CAPM
This is a notebook for CAPM in finance

It is a replication of the notebook(https://github.com/aldodec/Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model-CAPM-with-Python/), and I have made improvements as part of the learning process.

I included a comparison between the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the linear regression model. I showed in the notebook why the $\beta$ factor in CAPM is the same $\beta$ in the linear regression model.
